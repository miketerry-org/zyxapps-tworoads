  {{site_coach_fullname}}</h1>

<section class="intro">
  <p>
    Hi, I’m
    <strong>{{site_coach_fullname}}</strong>—a
    <strong>virtual life coach</strong>
    based in Salt Lake City. I’m truly glad you’re here. I help individuals gain
    clarity, purpose, and confidence—no matter where you're starting from or
    where in the world you are.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is Life Coaching and How Can It Help You?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Life coaching</strong>
    is about building momentum and making meaningful progress toward your goals.
    Whether you're navigating change, pursuing personal development, or simply
    feeling stuck, I’m here to support you. All coaching sessions are
    virtual—via phone or video—so you can connect in a way that’s private,
    convenient, and tailored to your comfort.

<section class="about-me">
  <h2>Meet Your Online Life Coach – Dylan Terry</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a 27-year-old Arizona native who found a second home—and a deeper
    purpose—in
    <strong>Salt Lake City, Utah</strong>, in 2012. My personal journey has
    included struggles with addiction, disability, and relationships. Through it
    all, I discovered resilience, self-trust, and the transformative power of
    support and growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    While therapy plays a vital role in emotional healing, sometimes what you
    need is forward momentum. As your
    <strong>online life coach</strong>, I offer a safe space, honest
    conversations, and practical tools to help you take the next step with
    clarity and courage.

  <h2>Life Coaching Services – How I Can Help You Move Forward</h2>
  <p>
    Feeling overwhelmed? Stuck? Not sure what’s next? You’re not alone—and you
    don’t have to figure it out by yourself. We’ll identify priorities and break
    things down into manageable steps that create real, sustainable change.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you’re navigating a life transition, facing career uncertainty,
    working through relationship struggles, or feeling unmotivated—I can help
    you gain clarity and take confident, intentional action toward your goals.
  </p>

  <h3>Life Coaching vs. Therapy: What’s the Difference?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Coaching is future-focused.</strong>
    While therapy helps you heal the past, life coaching helps you design your
    future. As your coach, I’m here to be your guide, thought partner, and
    accountability ally—to keep you motivated and moving forward with purpose.
